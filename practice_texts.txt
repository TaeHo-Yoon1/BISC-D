The Dvorak Simplified Keyboard was designed to increase typing speed and reduce finger fatigue through optimized key placement. Dr. August Dvorak and his brother-in-law Dr. William Dealey developed this layout in the 1930s after extensive research into typing efficiency and human anatomy. The layout places the most commonly used letters in the English language on the home row, reducing finger movement and increasing typing speed. Studies have shown that Dvorak users can achieve typing speeds up to 20% faster than QWERTY users with proper training. The keyboard layout is particularly beneficial for touch typists who want to maximize their efficiency and reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries.
